# Raw VNA files

- `fixation-reports_subject-v01-v89.xls` and `fixation-reports_subject-v90-v96.xls` are the fixation reports from `data/eyetracking/VNA_raw_data` in the VNA repo or in one of the two archives in the VNA OSF project under "code and data". Being raw data, I assume they are all identical but I haven't checked.
- `vna_age_gender_deid.csv` comes from `data/demographics` in the same three sources. Also not sure if the file is identical in all three places.
- `message-reports_subjects-all.xls` is a mystery file. It was modified in May 7, 2020 so it isn't something I exported using the Data Viewer or anything like that because I joined the lab in November 2021. It isn't in the VNA repo or the OSF archives. My best guess is that I must have found it on PN-OPUS/psych. I really wish I didn't rename it - it'd make finding the original so much easier. Oh, well.

## TODOs

[ ] Check wich version of the repo (GitHub vs two archives on OSF) the fixation reports came from.
[ ] Do the same for `vna_age_gender_deid.csv`.
[ ] Find the original version of `message-reports_subjects-all.xls` on PN-OPUS/psych.
[ ] Update file descriptions in this README.
